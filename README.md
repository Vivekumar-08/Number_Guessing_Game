# CodeAlpha_Project_Number_Guessing_Game
In this game, the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player must guess the number. After each guess, the computer provides hints to help the player, indicating whether the guess is "too high" or "too low." The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.
